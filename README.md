# Breast_Cancer_Prediction
Breast cancer (BC) is one of the most common cancers among women worldwide. Early diagnosis of BC into benign and melignant can improve the chances of survival significantly.
## Aim of the Project 
Breast cancer detection using 4 different models i.e. Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM, and Decision Tree Machine Learning models, and optimizing them for even better accuracy.The end result was that the LogisticRegression was optimized to get the accuracy of 97.07 % , SVM with accuracy of 96.10%, KNN with accuracy of 93.83% and decisionTree with accuracy of 90.58%.
